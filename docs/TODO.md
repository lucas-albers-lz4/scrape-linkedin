### Phase 5: Documentation Improvements üîÑ PARTIALLY COMPLETED

- ‚úÖ **Update README.md:** Removed references to clipboard mode, updated usage instructions
- ‚è≥ **Additional Documentation:** Consider adding architecture overview and design documentation
- ‚è≥ **Add More Code Documentation:** Add additional docstrings and type hints to remaining modules as needed

### Phase 6: Testing & Verification ‚è≥ TO DO

- ‚è≥ **Run Tests:** Verify all existing tests still pass
- ‚è≥ **Add New Tests:** Consider adding tests for any untested functionality
- ‚è≥ **Final Integration Test:** Test the complete workflow end-to-end

## Next Steps

1. Clean up redundant files and properly track new ones with git
2. Continue improving code documentation with docstrings and type hints
3. Run and possibly extend test suite
4. Add architecture overview documentation if desired
